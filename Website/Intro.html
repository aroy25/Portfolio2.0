        <p>Hey, To Whom Is reading this I won't to first say i hope you're having a worderful and amazing day at the time of me writing this I'm A 20 year old college student just trying to find his entry into the test word </p>
        <p></p>
        <h2><em>The Beginning</em></h2>
        <p>My Name is A'Shun Motley I was born in Wheeling, West Virgina. 
            I really dont know much about the town at all because I move long before I even made it to see the age of 1 years old,
        but from that point my mom was a single parent with 1 other kid at the time whom is my older brother Antonius Hurd.
    At this point in my life my family move down to Arkansas where I spent a signficant time of my life and was introduce to the sport of football, but as of right now thats another story we can branch off into.
</p>
        <p></p>
        <p> While In Arkansas I got very close to my grandparent Leroy and Rosemary Thornton 
            there no longer here with us anymore, but they will always have a big place in my heart 
        and I know their looking down on me everyday and just so proud. In my younger years these are the individuals 
    that took care of me because my mom was so young and at this time have to take care to other kids is hard for a single 
mom and not have a real father figure in my life i turned to Gregory Motley and Leroy Thornton to learn those things a father was
suppose to teach me and show me how to be a African American male in the united states. </p>

        <h1><em>Teenage Years</em></h1>
        <p>My teen years were maybe some of the hardest years in my life they made me who 
            I am today they showed me how to value life and to value family because when your struggling
            those are the ones you want there the most and growing up in the state of Tennessee was a love and hate relationship 
            for me, but it was more love just because this was one of the places I made myself who I am today and i'm thankful that god put in that place it's all love to my family and friends thats still there,
            they know who they are I miss the egg wars we had together in the middle of walmart or when we would shut down every 7 on 7 and my mom even added a addition to the 
            family my other brother Lil Woo even though your older than me your still lil bro but its all love 
        </p>
